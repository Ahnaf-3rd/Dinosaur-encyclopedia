  <h1 class="main-title">ðŸŒ¿ The Jurassic Period (201 â€“ 145 million years ago)</h1>

  <h2 class="section-title">Beginning</h2>
  <p>The Jurassic followed the Triassic extinction event, allowing dinosaurs to rapidly expand and dominate ecosystems. The climate became warmer and wetter, fueling lush vegetation and vast forests.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Expansion</h2>
  <p>Pangaea began to break apart into smaller continents, leading to diversification of species. Dinosaurs thrived in both size and variety, and the first birds evolved from small theropod dinosaurs.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>The Jurassic period was characterized by a warm, humid climate that supported extensive forests of conifers, ginkgoes, tree ferns, and cycads. These dense forests created multi-layered ecosystems with different niches for various herbivores. The breakup of Pangaea created isolated landmasses that led to unique evolutionary paths. Vast shallow seas rich in marine life separated the continents. Coral reefs expanded, providing habitats for diverse marine creatures. The period saw the development of complex predator-prey relationships, with large theropods hunting massive sauropods, while smaller dinosaurs and early mammals occupied understory niches.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Famous Animals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Brachiosaurus</b> â€“ a towering long-necked sauropod.</li>
    <li><b>Stegosaurus</b> â€“ known for its plates and spiked tail.</li>
    <li><b>Allosaurus</b> â€“ one of the top predators of the time.</li>
    <li><b>Archaeopteryx</b> â€“ an early bird-like dinosaur.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">End</h2>
  <p>The Jurassic ended gradually without a mass extinction, but evolutionary shifts paved the way for the even larger dinosaurs of the Cretaceous Period.</p>
